I used Pentesting strategies to analyze security flaws present in a simulated organization's ("Rekall Corp.") web applications, networks and Linux and Windows operating systems. Using tools like Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit/ Meterpreter to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities to provide a greater level of security for the environment. Once exploitation was complete I wrote a comprehensive Penetration Test Report that outlines the findings and analysis resulting from the test which provided detailed insights into the simulated organization's technical security posture by identifying vulnerabilities and potential weaknesses. Additionally, the report offered recommendations and remediation steps to address the identified issues.
